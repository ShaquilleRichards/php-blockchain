PHP BLOCKCHAIN README

This is a simple lockchain written in php, used to store data and make transactions.
At current it only supports basic contract storage and send/receiving from addresses, mining capabilities are currently been developed for a NodeJS version of this block that that would support most expected blockchain functions.
example: Mining, p2p Networking over the chain, smart contracts that support the development of blockchain apps, as of this time This chain functions as an initial proof of concept for the above.
